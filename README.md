### Phase 1: Planning & Scoping (The "Blueprint" Strategy)

Before writing a single line of code, this is the most critical phase.

#### 1. Define the Core Features (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)
Your goal is to get a functional site up quickly. Don't try to build everything at once.

*   **Landing Page:** A simple, attractive page explaining the hackathon (what, when, where, why).
*   **User Registration:** A form to collect essential participant data.
    *   Fields: Full Name, Email, Password, University/Company, T-shirt size, Dietary Restrictions, Resume/Portfolio Link.
*   **User Login/Authentication:** Allow registered users to log back in.
*   **User Dashboard:** A simple, private page a user sees after logging in.
    *   Shows their registration status (e.g., "Registered").
    *   Allows them to view/update their information.
*   **Team Formation:**
    *   Create a new team.
    *   Join an existing team using a unique code/link.
    *   View team members.
*   **Admin View (Simple):** A protected route where organizers can view and export a list of all registered participants as a CSV/Excel file.

#### 2. Define "Nice-to-Have" Features (Post-MVP)
List these separately. You can add them if you have time.

*   Project Submission Form.
*   Real-time announcements section.
*   Social logins (Google, GitHub).
*   Password reset functionality.
*   A "judging" portal.
*   Automated confirmation emails.

#### 3. Choose a Technology Stack
This choice depends on your team's skills and the need for speed.

| Category      | Popular Options                                       | Pros for a Hackathon Site                                                              | Cons                                                              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**  | **React (Next.js)**, **Vue (Nuxt.js)**, Svelte (SvelteKit) | Component-based, great for dynamic UIs, rich ecosystems. Frameworks like Next/Nuxt handle routing and server-side rendering easily. | Can have a steeper learning curve if you're new.                  |
|               | **HTML/CSS + Vanilla JS + Bootstrap/Tailwind**        | Extremely fast to set up for simple pages. No complex build steps.                     | Becomes hard to manage as the app grows more dynamic (e.g., dashboard). |
| **Backend**   | **Node.js (Express/NestJS)**                          | Fast, uses JavaScript (same language as frontend), huge library (npm) ecosystem.       | Asynchronous nature can be tricky for beginners.                   |
|               | **Python (Django/Flask)**                             | Django is "batteries-included" with a built-in admin panel (huge time saver!). Flask is minimal and flexible. | Can be slightly slower to set up than a Node/Express server.      |
|               | **Go (Gin)**                                          | Extremely performant and creates a single binary for easy deployment.                  | Smaller ecosystem, stricter typing can slow initial development. |
| **Database**  | **PostgreSQL / MySQL (SQL)**                          | Structured, reliable, great for relational data (users belong to teams).               | Requires defining a schema upfront, can be less flexible.         |
|               | **MongoDB (NoSQL)**                                   | Flexible schema, great for rapid prototyping where data structures might change.       | Can be harder to manage complex relationships.                     |
| **All-in-One**| **Firebase / Supabase (Backend-as-a-Service)**        | **(Highly Recommended for Speed)** Handles Auth, Database, and Hosting in one place. Reduces backend code you need to write by 90%. | Less control, potential vendor lock-in (not a big deal for a short-term project). |

### Phase 2: Core Development Strategies

This is how you'll build the features you defined.

#### 1. Architecture Strategy: Monolith vs. Serverless

*   **Monolithic Approach:**
    *   **What it is:** Your frontend and backend code are in the same project, deployed as a single unit (e.g., a Next.js app with API routes, or a Django app serving templates).
    *   **Why for a hackathon site:** **Simplicity.** It's faster to develop, easier to test, and has a single deployment process. This is the most practical choice for a small team on a deadline.

*   **Serverless / BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) Approach:**
    *   **What it is:** You build your frontend (e.g., in React) and connect it directly to a third-party service like **Firebase** or **Supabase** for all backend needs.
    *   **Why for a hackathon site:** **Extreme speed.**
        *   **Authentication:** Use their pre-built, secure login and registration flows in minutes.
        *   **Database:** Use Firestore or Supabase's Postgres DB without writing any backend server code for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
        *   **Hosting:** Deploy your frontend with one command.

#### 2. User Registration & Authentication Strategy

*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  User fills out the registration form on the frontend.
    2.  On submit, the frontend sends the data to a backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/register`).
    3.  **Backend Logic:**
        *   **Validate the data:** Is the email valid? Is the password strong enough? Are all required fields present? **Never trust frontend validation alone!**
        *   **Check for existing user:** Query the database to see if the email is already in use.
        *   **Hash the password:** **NEVER** store passwords in plain text. Use a strong, salted hashing algorithm like **bcrypt**.
        *   **Store user in the database:** Insert the new user's data (including the *hashed* password) into your `users` table.
        *   **Generate a token:** Create a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains the user's ID. This token proves they are logged in.
    4.  The backend sends the JWT back to the frontend.
    5.  The frontend stores the JWT (in `localStorage` or a cookie) and redirects the user to their dashboard.

*   **Session Management:** For every subsequent request to a protected page (like the dashboard), the frontend must include the JWT in the request headers. The backend then verifies the token before returning any private data.

#### 3. Data Storage & Modeling Strategy

*   **Define your Data Models (Schema):**
    *   `User`:
        *   `id` (Primary Key)
        *   `fullName` (String)
        *   `email` (String, Unique)
        *   `passwordHash` (String)
        *   `university` (String)
        *   `teamId` (Foreign Key, nullable)
        *   ...other fields
    *   `Team`:
        *   `id` (Primary Key)
        *   `teamName` (String, Unique)
        *   `joinCode` (String, Unique)
*   **Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):**
    *   An ORM like **Prisma**, **Sequelize** (for Node.js), or the **Django ORM** lets you interact with your database using simple code instead of writing raw SQL queries. This is a massive time-saver and reduces errors.

### Phase 3: Deployment & Operations Strategy

How your site will go live and stay live.

#### 1. Hosting Strategy

*   **PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service):** The best choice for ease of use.
    *   **Vercel / Netlify:** Perfect for frontend-focused or full-stack Next.js/Nuxt.js apps. They offer "Git Push to Deploy." You push to your main branch, and the site redeploys automatically.
    *   **Heroku / Render:** Great for traditional backend servers (Node/Express, Django/Flask). They also offer simple deployment from a Git repository.
*   **Serverless Platforms:**
    *   **Firebase Hosting / Supabase:** If you use their BaaS tools, using their hosting is the most seamless option.

#### 2. Security Best Practices (Non-Negotiable)

*   **HTTPS/SSL:** Your site must be served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. All modern hosting providers offer this for free.
*   **Environment Variables:** Store all sensitive information (database URLs, API keys, JWT secrets) in environment variables (`.env` file), not hard-coded in your source code.
*   **Input Validation:** Validate all incoming data on the **server-side**.
*   **Password Hashing:** Use **bcrypt** as mentioned.
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** If your frontend and backend are on different domains, configure your backend server to only accept requests from your frontend's domain.

### Recommended "Fast-Track" Stack & Workflow

For a typical hackathon page where speed is everything, here is a highly recommended path:

1.  **Framework:** **Next.js (React)**. It gives you a great structure for pages, a simple API routing system, and is perfect for modern deployment platforms.
2.  **Backend & Database:** **Supabase**.
    *   Use **Supabase Auth** for user registration and login. Their client library makes it incredibly simple. It handles password hashing, social logins, and JWTs for you.
    *   Use the **Supabase Postgres Database**. You can create your tables in their UI and interact with them directly from your Next.js frontend using their client library. **You write almost no custom backend code.**
3.  **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**. A utility-first CSS framework that lets you build modern designs quickly without writing custom CSS files.
4.  **Deployment:** **Vercel**. Connect your GitHub repository. Every time you `git push`, Vercel will automatically build and deploy your Next.js site.

**This combination (Next.js + Supabase + Vercel) allows a single developer to build and deploy a secure, dynamic registration site in a weekend.**
